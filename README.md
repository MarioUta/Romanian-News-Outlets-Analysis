# Romanian News Outlets Analysis


##########################

!DISCLAIMER!


The report is found in the ReportRO.ipynb and ReportRO.PDF files. The recommended one is the .ipynb as the PDF file has slight formatting issues, being added for convenience purposes only


This project is made for educational purposes only and does not attempt to harm in any way any of the news outlets featured in the report.


All the data (besides the World Bank GPD per capita data) is gathered by me. I am not a Data Analyst nor a statistician, please take all the findings with a grain of salt.


##########################

This project aims to analyze the titles of news articles from some of the most popular news outlets in Romania (Digi24, ProTV, and Observator) to see if the presence of certain keywords in the titles may indicate a change in the
GDP per capita of Romania.


The keywords (found in badwords.txt), generally have a bad connotation, which may indicate a decline in the quality of life.


These keywords are divided into three categories:
        
        1. Economic. Words that show bad economic trends
        2. War/Catastrophe. Words associated with war or tragedy
        3. Pandemic. Words associated with the COVID-19 pandemic


For gathering the data, I've used several web scrapers (see the Scrapers directory), that analyze the titles of the articles featured on each site. Every website analyzed has its specific web scraper, named accordingly.


All the data found is in the Database directory, and everything is named accordingly.



# Going onwards:

An English variant of the report may be added in the future

The report may be updated, by adding different insights and expanding the Database to other Romanian news outlets

I do not plan on making a similar project for any non-Romanian websites soon. If you want to create something similar, feel free to explore my work and to contact me
