# Romanian News Outlets Analysis


##########################
!DISCLAIMER!


This project is made for educational purposes only and does not attempt to harm in any way any of the news outlets featured in the report.  


All the data (besides the World Bank GPD per capita data) is gathered by me. I am not a Data Analyst nor a Statistican, please take all the findings with a grain of salt.

This project aims to analyse the titles of news articles from some of the most popular news outlets in Romania (Digi24, ProTV and Observator) to see if the presence of certain key words in the titles may indicate a change in the
GDP per capita of Romania.


The keywords (found in badwords.txt), generally have a bad connotation, which may indicate a decline in the quality of life.


These keywords are divided in three categories:
        
        1.Economic. Words that show bad economic trrends
        2.War/Catastrophe. Words associated with war or tragedy
        3.Pandemic. Words associated with the COVID-19 pandemic


For gathering the data, I've used several web scrapers (see the Scrapers directory), that analyse the titles of the articles featured on each site. Every website analysed has it's specific web scraper, named accordingly.


All the data found is in the Database directory, everything named accordinly.


The report is found in the ReportRO.ipynb file.


Going onwards:

    An English variant of the report may be added in the future

    The report may be updated, by adding different insights and expanding the Database to other Romanian news outlets

    I do not plan on making a similar project for any non-Romanian websites in the near future. If you want to create something similar, feel free to explore my work and to contact me
